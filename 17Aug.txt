I got a call for technical interview today 

It went not okayish. I was asked about OS and databases.
I didn't know either of them. 

But she did say - "Your Golang is Good" 

The HR said he'd let me know tomorrow. 

I'm still not sure what'd happen.

If I get selected I'd be happy. But If I won't be that disappointed either.

But still, I want to get this Internship. And I hope I do.

Learning about Golang today to do better for the interview tomorrow.
I still haven't completely made it through the go tour but I think I should finish it.

A quote that has been on my mind lately -
"I don't just want to live
I don't just want to fight 
I want to win" 
this is by my favorite chatacter - Ichigo Kurosaki

//maps in Golang
//slice 
//make function
//input and output of a function
//switch statement 
//go routine

for the past week I've been only focusing on Golang and I think I should continue with
the DSA part too. 

Today is 16th Aug, 2022
months left for 2023 : Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.
total months left: 4(30*4 = 120 days approximately)

Only 32.6% of the year is left
i.e. approximately 70% of the year has gone by and 
the DSA is still not finished.


This is a worrisome situtation in my opinion
I'd like to make time and figure out ways to learn the DSA concepts 
and Practise them to crack some great companies.
